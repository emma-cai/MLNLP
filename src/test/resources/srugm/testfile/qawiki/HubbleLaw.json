    "answer" :"Hubble's law is the name for the observation in physical cosmology that:  objects observed in deep space \\(extragalactic space, ~10 megaparsecs or more\\) are found to have a Doppler shift interpretable as relative velocity away from the Earth; and that this Doppler-shift-measured velocity, of various galaxies receding from the Earth, is approximately proportional to their distance from the Earth for galaxies up to a few hundred megaparsecs away\\.",
